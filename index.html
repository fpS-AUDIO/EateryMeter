        <h2>What is BMI?</h2>
        <p>
          Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measurement that uses height and weight to
          estimate a person's body fat, providing an easy and quick method to
          assess whether someone has an appropriate body weight for their
          height. BMI is widely used in the medical community to screen for
          obesity, underweight, and healthy weight ranges, though it does not
          directly measure body fat percentage.
        </p>
        <h2>How to Calculate BMI</h2>
        <p>
          BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms (kg) by
          their height in meters (m) squared. The formula is:
        </p>
        <div class="formula">
          BMI =
          <span class="fraction"
            ><span class="weight">Weight in kg</span><span class="line"></span
            ><span class="height">(Height in m)<sup>2</sup></span></span
          >
        </div>
        <h2>Interesting Facts about BMI</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Historical Context:</strong> The BMI was devised in the
            early 19th century by Adolphe Quetelet, a Belgian astronomer,
            mathematician, statistician, and sociologist. It was originally
            called the Quetelet Index.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Global Standards Vary:</strong> While the World Health
            Organization (WHO) provides a standard BMI classification, some
            countries and regions have adapted their classifications to better
            fit their population's health profiles.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Not a Direct Measure of Health:</strong> While BMI is a
            useful screening tool, it does not directly measure body fat or
            account for muscle mass, bone density, overall body composition, and
            racial and sex differences.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Use in Public Health:</strong> BMI is widely used in
            epidemiological studies to correlate the health effects of being
            overweight or obese with population health.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Alternative Measurements: </strong> Due to BMI's
            limitations, other measurements like waist-to-hip ratio (WHR),
            waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), and body fat percentage are also used
            to provide a more complete picture of an individual's health.

        <h2>What is BMR?</h2>
        <p>
          Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) is the number of calories required to keep
          your body functioning at rest, also known as metabolism. BMR accounts
          for the majority of an individual's calorie consumption each day and
          includes energy used for basic bodily functions such as breathing,
          circulation, cell production, and nutrient processing. It is a crucial
          metric for understanding calorie needs and managing weight.
        </p>
        <h2>How to Calculate BMR</h2>
        <p>
          BMR can be estimated through various formulas, with the Mifflin-St
          Jeor Equation being one of the most commonly used today. For men and
          women, the formulas are slightly different:
        </p>
        <div class="formula">
          For men: BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age
          in years) + 5<br />
          For women: BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 ×
          age in years) - 161
        </div>
        <h2>Interesting Facts about BMR</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Individual Variation:</strong> BMR varies significantly
            among individuals due to factors such as age, weight, height,
            gender, and body composition. Muscle mass, for example, increases
            BMR due to the energy required to maintain muscle.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Impact of Lifestyle:</strong> Physical activity and diet can
            influence BMR. Regular exercise, particularly strength training, can
            boost BMR by increasing muscle mass.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Historical Methods:</strong> The original methods to measure
            BMR were developed in the early 20th century by J. Arthur Harris and
            Francis G. Benedict. These involved measuring oxygen consumption
            under specific conditions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Use in Nutrition and Fitness:</strong> Understanding one's
            BMR is essential for creating effective diet and exercise plans. It
            helps in estimating the total number of calories an individual
            should consume to lose, maintain, or gain weight.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Adjustments with Age:</strong> BMR decreases with age. This
            decline starts after the age of 20 and is partly due to the loss of
            muscle mass as people age, highlighting the importance of physical
            activity.

        <h2>What is TEF?</h2>
        <p>
          The Thermic Effect of Food (TEF), also known as dietary-induced
          thermogenesis, is the amount of energy expended above the basal
          metabolic rate as a result of processing food for use and storage. It
          represents the calories needed to digest, absorb, and metabolize the
          nutrients in your food. TEF varies by nutrient, with protein having
          the highest thermic effect, followed by carbohydrates and fats.
        </p>
        <h2>How to Calculate TEF</h2>
        <p>
          TEF is typically estimated as a percentage of total caloric intake.
          The average values for calculating TEF are:
        </p>
        <div class="formula">
          - Protein: 20-30% of energy consumed<br />
          - Carbohydrates: 5-10% of energy consumed<br />
          - Fats: 0-3% of energy consumed<br />
        </div>
        <p>
          Therefore, the TEF can be calculated by applying these percentages to
          the caloric intake from each macronutrient in your diet.
        </p>
        <h2>Interesting Facts about TEF</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Impact on Total Energy Expenditure:</strong> Although it
            contributes the least to total daily energy expenditure compared to
            BMR and physical activity, TEF plays a crucial role in weight
            management and metabolic health.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Protein and Metabolism:</strong> The higher TEF of protein
            can contribute to the "metabolic advantage" of high-protein diets in
            weight loss, as digesting protein requires more energy than other
            nutrients.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Meal Frequency:</strong> Some studies suggest that meal
            frequency can influence TEF, though evidence is mixed. Smaller, more
            frequent meals might increase total TEF, but the overall impact on
            weight management is still debated.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>TEF and Weight Loss:</strong> Increasing the proportion of
            calories from high-TEF nutrients (like protein) can slightly boost
            daily calorie burn, aiding in weight loss efforts.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Adaptive Thermogenesis:</strong> TEF can vary between
            individuals and can be influenced by factors such as obesity, weight
            loss history, and even certain health conditions, contributing to
            individual differences in metabolism.

        <h2>What is TDEE?</h2>
        <p>
          Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) is the total number of calories
          you burn each day, accounting for all activities. This encompasses
          energy spent while resting (Basal Metabolic Rate or BMR), the calories
          burned through physical activities (exercise and everyday movements),
          and the Thermic Effect of Food (TEF), which is the energy used to
          digest food. Understanding your TDEE is crucial for managing weight,
          as it helps tailor dietary intake to meet personal fitness goals,
          whether it's losing, gaining, or maintaining weight.
        </p>
        <h2>How to Calculate TDEE</h2>
        <p>
          TDEE is calculated by first determining your BMR using formulas such
          as the Mifflin-St Jeor Equation and then adjusting that number based
          on your activity level using a multiplier. The equation looks like
          this:
        </p>
        <div class="formula">TDEE = BMR × Activity Multiplier</div>
        <p>
          Activity multipliers may vary, but they generally range as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sedentary (little or no exercise): BMR × 1.2</li>
          <li>
            Lightly active (light exercise/sports 1-3 days/week): BMR × 1.375
          </li>
          <li>
            Moderately active (moderate exercise/sports 3-5 days/week): BMR ×
            1.55
          </li>
          <li>
            Very active (hard exercise/sports 6-7 days a week): BMR × 1.725
          </li>
          <li>
            Extra active (very hard exercise/sports & a physical job): BMR × 1.9
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Interesting Facts about TDEE</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Personalization is Key:</strong> TDEE calculations provide a
            personalized estimate of calorie needs, making them more accurate
            than generic calorie recommendations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Dynamic Nature:</strong> Your TDEE can change over time due
            to alterations in weight, age, activity level, and even changes in
            muscle mass.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Foundation for Dietary Planning:</strong> Nutritionists and
            fitness professionals use TDEE to design effective diet and exercise
            programs tailored to individual goals.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Role in Weight Management:</strong> Balancing calorie intake
            with your TDEE is essential for weight management. Consuming
            calories below TDEE leads to weight loss, while exceeding TDEE
            results in weight gain.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Impact of Activity Level:</strong> Increasing your activity
            level is a powerful way to raise your TDEE, which can facilitate
            weight loss or allow for a higher calorie intake while maintaining
            weight.

        <h2>What is Macronutrient Distribution?</h2>
        <p>
          Macronutrient distribution refers to the ratio of carbohydrates,
          proteins, and fats that an individual consumes as part of their total
          daily calorie intake. This distribution is key to achieving specific
          health and fitness goals, such as weight loss, muscle gain, or
          maintaining a healthy weight. Each macronutrient plays a unique role
          in the body, contributing to energy production, muscle repair, and
          overall metabolic function.
        </p>

        <h2>How to Determine Your Macronutrient Ratios</h2>
        <p>
          Determining your ideal macronutrient ratios involves considering your
          Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) and your specific health and
          fitness goals. The distribution of macronutrients can significantly
          impact your ability to lose fat, build muscle, or maintain your
          current physique in a healthy manner.
        </p>

        <h2>Guidelines for Macronutrient Ratios Based on Goals</h2>
        <p>
          Once you know your goals, you can apply different macronutrient ratios
          to your diet. These are general guidelines and should be adjusted
          based on personal needs, preferences, and feedback:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Weight Loss:</strong> 40% Carbohydrates, 35% Protein, 25%
            Fat
          </li>
